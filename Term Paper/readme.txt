About the paper:

Significant progress has been made in the digital realm, especially online, where most activities now take place. Nonetheless, there is a growing risk due to the inventiveness of cyberattacks, with rogue URLs posing a serious hazard. These URLs seek to trick unsuspecting visitors and obtain unauthorized data, which could undermine the system and result in significant losses. For this reason, website security is essential. This study offers a thorough analysis of the literature with an emphasis on machine-learning methods for identifying malicious URLs. It also discusses current issues with feature types, datasets, detection technologies, and limits. It also highlights the security of the research on identifying Arabic websites with dangerous content and makes recommendations for future research paths. The report concludes by outlining difficulties in detecting malicious URLs and suggesting possible fixes.
