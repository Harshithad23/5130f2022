One thing I am proud of accomplishing in this week is taking an initiative to learn is dance. Dance is wonderful way to express myself, improve my physical health, and connect with others as well. It's a great way to relieve stress, boost my mood, and make new friends.The most important thing is to have fun and enjoy the process. I feel dance is a great way to let loose and express myself. I'm so happy that ive decided to learn something new and exciting.
